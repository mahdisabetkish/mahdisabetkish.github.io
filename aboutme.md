### **Hello! I'm Mahdi.**

I’m a researcher, a problem-solver, and a mathematician at heart.

Ever since I started my studies, I've been captivated by the structure and elegance of mathematics—the way complex ideas can be built from a few simple, logical rules. During my PhD, I realized that the world of Artificial Intelligence, especially in areas like computer vision and language, was full of fascinating puzzles that could be looked at through this same mathematical lens.

That’s the core of my work today: **I use the rigor of mathematics to build AI that is more logical, robust, and less dependent on massive labeled datasets.**

### **My Focus: Smarter, Self-Reliant AI**

What does that really mean? I specialize in a field called **self-supervised learning (SSL)**. In simple terms, instead of spoon-feeding an AI millions of hand-labeled images, I design frameworks that encourage the model to learn from the world on its own—by observing patterns, understanding context, and building an internal, logical representation of what it "sees."

By grounding these models in mathematical principles, my goal is to create AI that is not only powerful but also more interpretable and reliable. It’s about moving from AI that just memorizes to AI that truly understands.

### **From Theory to Code**

I believe that ideas are only as good as their implementation. I bring these concepts to life using **Python** and **PyTorch**, and I love the entire process, from sketching out a new idea on a whiteboard to building and testing a final model. You can find some of my open-source work over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mahdisabetkish).

### **Let's Connect**

This website is where I share my projects, publications, and thoughts. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a potential collaborator, or just someone curious about the intersection of math and AI, I’d be happy to connect.
