title: About Me
subtitle: PhD in Pure Mathematics | Researcher in Self-Supervised Learning
---

I am a researcher and recent PhD graduate in Pure Mathematics, specializing in the intersection of abstract algebra and self-supervised learning.

My core research focuses on developing more structured, robust, and data-efficient models for computer vision by grounding them in mathematical principles. I design novel pretext tasks and contrastive loss functions that enforce homomorphic properties on feature embedding spaces, aiming to create representations that are not only accurate but also semantically meaningful.

With a strong foundation in both theoretical mathematics and practical machine learning implementation using tools like Python and PyTorch, my goal is to bridge the gap between these two fields to advance the frontiers of representation learning.

This website serves as a portfolio of my work. Please feel free to explore my publications, delve into my research projects, or download my full CV for a more detailed overview.
