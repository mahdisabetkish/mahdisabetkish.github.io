**PhD in Pure Mathematics and Researcher in Self-Supervised Learning**


I am a researcher and recent Ph.D. graduate in **Pure Mathematics** with a deep specialization in the theory and application of **machine learning**. My academic journey has been driven by a single goal: to bridge the gap between the abstract elegance of mathematics and the practical challenges of modern artificial intelligence. My work is focused on advancing AI—particularly in **computer vision** and **natural language processing**—by grounding learning models in rigorous mathematical principles.

My core research explores how to develop AI systems that are more **structured, robust, and data-efficient**. This involves investigating novel self-supervised learning frameworks that enable models to learn the intrinsic rules and semantics of data without relying on massive labeled datasets. By enforcing a consistent, logical structure on the learned feature representations, the goal is to create models that are not only accurate but also more interpretable and reliable.

With a strong foundation in both theoretical mathematics and hands-on implementation using tools like **Python** and **PyTorch**, my work aims to advance the frontiers of representation learning. This website serves as a portfolio of my work. Please feel free to explore my publications, delve into my research projects, or contact me.
