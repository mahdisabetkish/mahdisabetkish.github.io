**Recognition & Milestones**

My academic path has been shaped by a few key moments and recognitions that I'm proud to share.

**A Foundation of Excellence**

From my first day as an undergraduate to my final day as a PhD candidate, I was supported by a **full, merit-based national scholarship**. This honor was awarded for outstanding performance, and I worked hard to live up to it by **graduating at the top of my class for all three of my degrees**. This consistent support allowed me to focus completely on my studies and research.

**Recognition for My Work**

Along the way, I was also honored to have my specific research and projects recognized:

*   My work in innovation was awarded the **Khwarizmi Youth Award**, a national prize for research and invention.
*   My Master's thesis was selected for the **Best Thesis Award** for its contributions to computational science.
*   My practical data science skills were put to the test in the **Quera Data Analysis Competition**, where I was a finalist.
