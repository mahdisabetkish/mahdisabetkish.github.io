#### **Teaching Philosophy**

My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that deep understanding comes from bridging the abstract with the practical. With a background in both Pure Mathematics and computational programming, I strive to demystify complex theoretical concepts by connecting them to tangible, real-world applications. Whether teaching abstract algebra or a Python programming workshop, I aim to foster an inclusive and interactive learning environment where students feel empowered to ask questions and develop their own problem-solving intuition. My ultimate goal is to equip students not just with knowledge, but with the critical thinking and technical skills to become confident, independent learners and problem-solvers.
